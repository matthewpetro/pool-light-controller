Code to control a Pentair IntelliBrite light by using an [ESP32 microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) with an attached relay.

Pentair IntelliBrite lights can be changed to different preprogrammed colors and scenes by cycling the power. The full list of scenes can be found in the [manual](https://www.pentair.com/content/dam/extranet/nam/pentair-pool/residential/manuals/lighting/intellibrite-5g-white-color-pool-spa-lights-manual-english-french.pdf). This controller code runs on an ESP32 microcontroller such as the [Adafruit HUZZAH32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3619) and can cycle the power via an attached relay. The code also connects to wifi and implements a REST interface that enables the attached IntelliBrite light to be connected to a home automation system.
